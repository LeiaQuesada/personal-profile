        <h4>What I've been up to:</h4>
        
            <p>I'm now a Software Engineer in training with <a href="https://techtonica.org/" target=blank><strong>Techtonica</strong></a> based out of San Francisco, CA, USA. WHOO HOO! Heartfelt realness alert! I fell in love with this organization as their goals of obliterating barriers and truly giving impactful actions in supporting women and nonbinary folx create generational wealth and financial stability for themselves and their families is <strong>amazing</strong>. Bringing those up around you who didn't have access to such aspirations elevates whole communities. The ultimate gift that gives. Wow, I wouldn't even have known how to put into words those feelings and dreams. Finding Techtonica, for me, has been an incredibly empowering experience. 
            <br>
            So now, focus is on taking full advantage of this gift and really practice the coding resources to deploy beautiful dynamic webpages and apps. I got a taste of what it feels like to work in a tech company as I was hired to provide client facing services, with a biomedical device tech start up, Uniform Teeth.  Our encouraging engineering team and Clinic Ops were the best and I was there in early stages of growth so I know the work and grit needed to make it as well as sneak peak into how code is quickly deployed. 
            <br>
            With Techtonica, I'm excited to have already delved well into JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript), HTML, and CSS. Currently, I'm starting to practice frameworks beginning with Bootstrap to style and add responsiveness to websites. Soon, I'll share some of my skills to help clinics make their patient experiences more seemless! Exciting!</p>

        <h4>Other Sources of Joy:</h4>

            <p>When I'm not writing code or running around the clinic, I love roaming around different cities in all types of weather. The energy of different locations can give an exhilirating feeling. Did you know that the best time to go foraging for mushrooms is after a rain? I've come across many beauties and collected really cool spore prints. I don't eat the fungi (I'm not a cannibal, you monster! Get it? Fun guy? hehe.. ok). As I was saying, I have yet to build a pallate for them, I'll stick with my government cheese, thank you.</p>

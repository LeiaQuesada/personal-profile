        <h4>What I'm up to these days:</h4>
        
            <p>I'm a Software Engineer in training with <a href="https://techtonica.org/" target=blank><strong>Techtonica</strong></a> from San Francisco, CA, USA. I am in love with this organization as the message of breaking barriers and impactful inclusion to really support women and nonbinary folx to create generational wealth and financial stability. Wow, I wouldn't even have known how to put into words those feelings and desires. Finding Techtonica, for me, has been an incredible experience. 
                
            To fully commit to the program and give the attention this movement is going to achieve, I left my full time dental career. I hope to transfer my team's confidence in me, to my aspirations in this new programming journey. I have to say, rather proudly, that I was referred to as a 'Green Beret' for a biomedical tech start up, Uniform Teeth, also based out of San Francisco, CA. Our encouraging engineering team and Clinic Ops were the best. I'll do friends and family proud and I'll share my skills with you. I'm excited to have already delved well into JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript), HTML, and CSS. I'm starting to practice frameworks beginning with Bootstrap to style and add responsiveness to websites. Soon, I'll share some of my skills to help clinics make their patient experiences more seemless! Exciting!</p>

        <h4>Other activities I enjoy doing:</h4>

            <p>When I'm not writing code or running around the clinic, I love roaming around different cities in all types of weather. The energy of different locations can give an exhilirating feeling. Did you know that the best time to go foraging for mushrooms is after a rain? I've come across many beauties and collected really cool spore prints. I don't eat the fungi (I'm not a cannibal, you monster! Get it? Fun guy? hehe.. ok). As I was saying, I have yet to build a pallate for them, I'll stick with my government cheese, thank you.</p>
